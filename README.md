This is a place where everything about me, my projects and skills can be found. This website isn't just my portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer & engineer, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

## What I've used to build it

Hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
Built with:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
- [Chakra-UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## ðŸš¨ Forking this repository (Please read!)

I value keeping my code open source, but please take note that it is not intended to be used as a starter template or theme. For that purpose you could follow up with [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) and [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) documentation. **Plagiarism is bad** and it is quite discouraging seeing someone copying your work without a proper attribution. I spent substantial amount of time and effort building and designing this website and I am proud of my work!

All I am asking for is not to claim this effort as your own. Please email me via contact below and give a proper credit by linking back to [stepanpavlov.com](stepanpavlov.com) if you wish to fork this repo.
